## Core Demonstration Scenarios

### Scenario 1: "Rush Release Crisis Prevention"
**Business Context**: New release scheduled for major retailer promotion in 3 days, ONIX file fails validation at last minute.

**Workflow Demo**:
1. Operations manager uploads ONIX file for upcoming release
2. System immediately flags 3 contract compliance violations (territory restrictions for Kobo, missing required fields for Amazon)
3. Nielsen completeness score shows 67% (Fair rating, 30-50% sales uplift potential)
4. System generates specific fix recommendations with estimated correction time (2.5 hours)
5. Dashboard shows cost avoidance: $300 rejection fee + 4-day delay prevented

**Value Demonstration**: Instead of 2-day crisis response costing $1,200 in overtime and missed promotion deadline, issues identified and resolved in 45 minutes.

### Scenario 2: "Backlist Optimization Campaign"  
**Business Context**: Publisher reviewing 500+ backlist titles for metadata enhancement to boost discoverability.

**Workflow Demo**:
1. Batch upload of 15 representative backlist ONIX files
2. Nielsen scoring reveals distribution: 3 excellent (85%+), 5 good (70-84%), 7 fair (50-69%)
3. Contract compliance analysis shows 40% have outdated territory restrictions
4. System prioritizes 12 titles with highest improvement potential vs. effort ratio
5. Executive dashboard shows projected annual revenue impact: $47,500 from metadata improvements

**Value Demonstration**: Strategic data-driven decisions replace manual review, identifying $47,500 opportunity that would have taken 3 weeks to discover manually.

### Scenario 3: "New Retailer Contract Integration"
**Business Context**: Publisher signs exclusive distribution agreement with new digital platform requiring specific metadata compliance.

**Workflow Demo**:
1. Contract manager inputs new retailer requirements into validation profile
2. System tests existing catalog (500 titles) against new contract rules
3. Compliance analysis reveals 127 titles need updates (average 15 minutes each)
4. System generates prioritized work queue based on sales velocity and fix complexity
5. Dashboard tracks progress: 89% compliant after 2 days, estimated completion in 4 days total

**Value Demonstration**: Proactive compliance verification prevents post-launch issues, ensuring smooth retailer relationship and avoiding potential distribution suspension.

## Realistic Data Requirements

### Book Categories for Compelling Demos
1. **Fiction Bestseller** (High stakes): Literary fiction with multiple territory rights, series information
2. **Educational Textbook** (Complex metadata): Academic publisher, detailed subject classifications, pricing tiers  
3. **Independent Fiction** (Common scenario): Small press, limited territories, basic metadata
4. **Children's Picture Book** (Visual requirements): Age ranges, cover image compliance, safety restrictions
5. **Technical Manual** (B2B focus): Professional publisher, industry classifications, corporate sales channels

### Author-Publisher Relationship Patterns
- **Traditional Publishing**: Standard royalty contract, worldwide rights, established imprint
- **Hybrid Publishing**: Shared cost model, limited territory rights, author retains specific rights
- **Educational Publishing**: Work-for-hire agreements, institutional sales focus, version control requirements
- **Self-Publishing Services**: Author as publisher, basic distribution agreements, simplified compliance

### Contract Complexity Levels
1. **Basic Distribution** (Amazon KDP): Simple territory restrictions, standard metadata requirements
2. **Premium Retailer** (Ingram/Baker & Taylor): Enhanced metadata needs, delivery schedule requirements  
3. **International Rights** (Multi-territory): Complex geographic restrictions, currency considerations
4. **Educational Channel** (Academic distributors): Subject classification mandates, pricing approval workflows

### Sample Data Volume Strategy
- **Demonstration Set**: 15-25 carefully crafted ONIX files representing diversity of scenarios
- **Batch Processing Demo**: 50-100 files showing scalability and performance
- **Synthetic Data Approach**: Use realistic but fabricated publisher data to avoid confidentiality issues
- **Anonymous Reference Data**: Partner with mid-tier publisher for sanitized real-world sample
