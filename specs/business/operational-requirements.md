# MetaOps Validator - Operational Requirements Specification
## Mid-Tier Publishers (1,000-10,000 titles/year)

### Executive Summary

MetaOps Validator addresses the critical operational challenge faced by mid-tier publishers: manual ONIX validation consuming 30-60 minutes per title, leading to costly feed rejections and delayed distribution. This specification defines operational requirements for a pre-feed validation system that reduces per-title validation time by 40+ minutes while preventing retailer feed rejections.

**Target Impact:**
- Reduce validation time from 30-60 minutes to under 10 minutes per title
- Eliminate 90%+ of feed rejections due to ONIX errors
- Enable same-day metadata distribution for rush titles
- Free metadata teams to focus on content enhancement vs. error correction

- **System Cost Offset**: MetaOps Validator subscription vs. manual validation cost

**ROI Calculation Components:**
```
Annual ROI = (Direct Savings + Rework Avoidance + Opportunity Recovery) - System Cost
           / System Cost

Where:
- Direct Savings = 40 min/title × $50/hour × 5,000 titles = $166,667
- Rework Avoidance = $2,000/rejection × 500 prevented rejections = $1,000,000
