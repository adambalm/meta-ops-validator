# MetaOps Validator - Pre-Feed ONIX Validation System
## Technical Specification v1.0

### Executive Summary

The MetaOps Validator is an operational ONIX validation system targeting mid-tier publishers (1,000-10,000 titles/year) with the core value proposition of saving 40 minutes per title, preventing feed rejections, and protecting revenue streams. Built on our proven three-tier validation pipeline, this system provides comprehensive pre-feed validation with sales impact metrics.

**Target Market**: Mid-tier publishers seeking to eliminate costly feed rejections and accelerate time-to-market
**Key Differentiator**: Pre-feed validation with quantified sales impact analysis
**Technical Foundation**: Existing XSD → Schematron → Rule DSL pipeline with namespace-aware processing

---

## 1. Core Technical Architecture

### 1.1 Foundation Components

**Validation Pipeline (INVARIANT ORDER)**
```
1. XSD Validation (validators/onix_xsd.py)
   └── Structural validation against ONIX 3.0 schema
   └── Namespace-aware XML parsing
   └── Performance target: <5s for typical catalog files

2. Schematron Validation (validators/onix_schematron.py)
   └── Business rule validation using ONIX best practices
   └── Territory, date, and composite validation
   └── Performance target: <10s for complex rulesets

3. Rule DSL Validation (rules/engine.py)
   └── Publisher-specific and retailer-specific rules
   └── Completeness scoring against Nielsen metadata standards
   └── Performance target: <15s for comprehensive rule evaluation
```

**Namespace Compliance (CRITICAL)**
- Production ONIX files MUST use namespace-aware XPath processing
- Support for both reference tags (`http://ns.editeur.org/onix/3.0/reference`) and short tags
- Automatic namespace detection and appropriate processing selection

### 1.2 API-First Architecture

**Core API Gateway** (`src/metaops/api/gateway.py`)
```python
# Primary endpoints for rapid market entry
POST /api/v1/validate/realtime        # <30s SLA validation
POST /api/v1/validate/batch           # Asynchronous catalog validation  
POST /api/v1/validate/retailer-submit # Multi-retailer validation + submission
GET  /api/v1/monitoring/sla-dashboard # Performance and cost metrics
```

**Integration Points**
- REST API with OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- Webhook notifications for batch processing
- JWT authentication with tenant isolation
- CORS support for web dashboard integration

### 1.3 Multi-Retailer Validation Framework

**Retailer Profile System** (`src/metaops/integrations/retailer_profiles.py`)
```python
# Extensible retailer validation architecture
class RetailerProfile(ABC):
    - Namespace-aware XPath validation rules
    - Business constraint validation
    - API integration patterns
    - Concurrent validation execution

# Initial retailer implementations
- Amazon KDP Profile (digital publishing focus)
- IngramSpark Profile (print-on-demand focus)
- Extensible for additional retailers (Barnes & Noble, Kobo, etc.)
```

**Concurrent Validation**
- Parallel validation across multiple retailer requirements
- Sub-30-second processing for standard catalog validation
- Error aggregation and priority ranking
