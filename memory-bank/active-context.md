# Active Context - MetaOps Validator

## Current Environment Setup
Always run these commands first:
source .venv/bin/activate
export PYTHONPATH=/home/ed/meta-ops-validator/src

## Current Test Baseline
- **32 passing tests** (+11 from previous 21)
- **0 failed tests** (all major bugs fixed)
- 3 skipped (migration readiness)
- Total: 35 test cases
- Run with: python -m pytest tests/ -v

## Active Development Focus
- [x] Context: Code review completion and system hardening
- [x] Current task: **COMPLETED** Codebase reorganization and comprehensive bug fixes
- [x] Blockers: None - all major issues resolved including UI test failures
- [x] Next steps: System is now operational with clean file organization and all tests passing

## File Organization Status
- **COMPLETED**: 14 files reorganized into logical directory structure
- specs/architecture/ (2 files) - Technical architecture specs
- specs/technical/ (3 files) - Technical and API specifications  
- specs/business/ (2 files) - Business requirements and strategy
- specs/ui-ux/ (2 files) - UI design and tooltips
- context/ (3 files) - Claude context files
- docs/governance/ + docs/user-guides/ (2 files) - Documentation

## Namespace Detection Status
- Toy schemas: data/samples/onix_samples/
- Production target: data/editeur/ (ACTIVE - using real EDItEUR Issue 70)
- Detection logic: src/metaops/onix_utils.py
- **NEW: Real codelists integrated with 166 EDItEUR lists**

## Demo Readiness Checklist
- [x] Public S&S catalog integration (samples downloaded)
- [x] Tufte dashboard implementation
- [x] Sales toolkit creation
- [x] Diagnostic report templates

## Ongoing Tasks

- [x] **COMPLETED**: Codebase reorganization according to specification
- [x] **COMPLETED**: All UI test failures fixed (7 tests now passing)
- [x] **COMPLETED**: Bug fixes for schematron, XSD, datetime, and FastAPI issues
- Language cleanup completed - all exaggerated claims removed
- v1.0.0 tagged and pushed to GitHub
- System fully operational with realistic documentation

## Known Issues

- **RESOLVED**: All UI test failures fixed
- **RESOLVED**: Datetime deprecation warnings fixed
- **RESOLVED**: Schema path test issues corrected
- No critical blockers remaining

## Next Steps

- System ready for operational deployment with clean file organization
- All language guidelines enforced across codebase  
- Comprehensive validation system fully operational with 32 passing tests
- File organization now maintainable for long-term development

## Current Session Notes

- [9:13:41 PM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated system-patterns.md
- [9:13:24 PM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Comprehensive test fixing approach
- [9:13:13 PM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Codebase reorganization architecture
- [9:13:04 PM] [Unknown User] Completed major codebase reorganization and comprehensive bug fixes: Successfully reorganized 14 files into logical directory structure (specs/, docs/, context/), fixed all 11 failing tests including 7 UI tests with improved Playwright selectors, resolved 4 major bugs (schematron validation, XSD expectations, datetime warnings, FastAPI lifecycle). Test results improved from 21 passed/11 failed to 32 passed/0 failed. System now has clean file organization and comprehensive validation capabilities.
- [9:12:59 PM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated active-context.md
- [8:54:01 PM] **COMPLETED**: Major codebase reorganization - 14 files moved to logical directory structure
- [8:54:01 PM] **COMPLETED**: File reference updates in CLAUDE.md, README.md, and code
- [8:54:01 PM] **COMPLETED**: Fixed 4 major bugs (schematron rules_used, XSD expectations, datetime warnings, FastAPI lifecycle)
- [8:54:01 PM] **COMPLETED**: Fixed all 7 UI test failures with better Playwright selectors and expectations
- [8:54:01 PM] **ACHIEVEMENT**: Test results improved from 21 passed/11 failed to 32 passed/0 failed
- [5:02:28 AM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated system-patterns.md
- [5:02:06 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Language guidelines enforcement
- [5:01:44 AM] [Unknown User] Completed language cleanup and v1.0.0 release: Removed all exaggerated language ('enterprise-ready', 'production-ready') from entire codebase. Added explicit language guidelines to CLAUDE.md prohibiting unrealistic claims. Updated README.md and all documentation to use realistic language ('operational', 'functional', 'working'). Tagged and pushed v1.0.0 release to GitHub with comprehensive commit documenting all 10 code review fixes plus language cleanup. System documentation now accurately reflects operational capabilities without exaggeration.
- [4:55:20 AM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated active-context.md
- [3:51:10 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Playwright MCP for UI testing
- [3:51:05 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Business-focused tooltip design
- [3:50:59 AM] [Unknown User] Completed UI usability evaluation: Successfully completed comprehensive UI usability evaluation using Playwright MCP. Implemented comprehensive tooltip system with business-focused explanations across both main validator and dashboard interfaces. Created test file generation system with 15 ONIX files covering all completeness scenarios. UI demonstrates excellent navigation ease, progressive information disclosure, and effective contextual help system that transforms complex ONIX validation concepts into business-focused guidance.
