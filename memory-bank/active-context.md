## File Organization Status
- **COMPLETED**: 14 files reorganized into logical directory structure
- specs/architecture/ (2 files) - Technical architecture specs
- specs/technical/ (3 files) - Technical and API specifications  
- specs/business/ (2 files) - Business requirements and strategy

## Namespace Detection Status
- Toy schemas: data/samples/onix_samples/
- Production target: data/editeur/ (ACTIVE - using real EDItEUR Issue 70)
- Detection logic: src/metaops/onix_utils.py
- **NEW: Real codelists integrated with 166 EDItEUR lists**

## Demo Readiness Checklist

- Address any issues found in testing
## Current Session Notes

- [1:36:00 AM] [Unknown User] Completed Stage A-B-C implementation with comprehensive business workflow integration: Successfully implemented three-stage development plan:
- Stage A: Fixed technical bugs, external IP configuration, mobile accessibility
- Stage B: Built complete ONIX generation capability with contract-based filtering
- Stage C: Added comprehensive business workflow integration with contract management, distributor simulation, and workflow visualization
Created comprehensive demo test script (test_stage_abc_demo.py) for validation.
Established process hygiene rules in CLAUDE.md to prevent resource leaks and data integrity issues.
- [1:11:24 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Critical ONIX Integration Gap Analysis
- [1:09:40 AM] [Unknown User] UX Analysis: Analyzed comprehensive user feedback for MetaOps book-author-contract demo system. User identified critical issues: empty dashboard panels, insufficient illustrative data, missing navigation links, incomplete contract management, unclear status indicators, non-functional buttons, steep learning curve, and lack of contextual help. Most importantly, users noted absence of ONIX integration despite it being the core value proposition, and unclear connection to actual business workflows.
- [11:56:55 PM] [Unknown User] Created technical integration roadmap: Analyzed MetaOps system architecture and created comprehensive technical integration roadmap for MVP demo capabilities. Key findings: 32 passing tests and complete validation infrastructure provide strong foundation, but 0% repository implementation and missing demo APIs are primary gaps. Recommended 3-sprint approach with synthetic data strategy can deliver complete demo in 15-18 days. Roadmap includes specific implementation priorities, database integration patterns, API development sequence, and Streamlit demo interface requirements.
- [9:13:41 PM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated system-patterns.md
- [9:13:24 PM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Comprehensive test fixing approach
- [9:13:13 PM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Codebase reorganization architecture
- [9:13:04 PM] [Unknown User] Completed major codebase reorganization and comprehensive bug fixes: Successfully reorganized 14 files into logical directory structure (specs/, docs/, context/), fixed all 11 failing tests including 7 UI tests with improved Playwright selectors, resolved 4 major bugs (schematron validation, XSD expectations, datetime warnings, FastAPI lifecycle). Test results improved from 21 passed/11 failed to 32 passed/0 failed. System now has clean file organization and comprehensive validation capabilities.
- [9:12:59 PM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated active-context.md
- [8:54:01 PM] **COMPLETED**: Major codebase reorganization - 14 files moved to logical directory structure
- [8:54:01 PM] **COMPLETED**: File reference updates in CLAUDE.md, README.md, and code
- [8:54:01 PM] **COMPLETED**: Fixed 4 major bugs (schematron rules_used, XSD expectations, datetime warnings, FastAPI lifecycle)
- [8:54:01 PM] **COMPLETED**: Fixed all 7 UI test failures with better Playwright selectors and expectations
- [8:54:01 PM] **ACHIEVEMENT**: Test results improved from 21 passed/11 failed to 32 passed/0 failed
- [5:02:28 AM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated system-patterns.md
- [5:02:06 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Language guidelines enforcement
- [5:01:44 AM] [Unknown User] Completed language cleanup and v1.0.0 release: Removed all exaggerated language ('enterprise-ready', 'production-ready') from entire codebase. Added explicit language guidelines to CLAUDE.md prohibiting unrealistic claims. Updated README.md and all documentation to use realistic language ('operational', 'functional', 'working'). Tagged and pushed v1.0.0 release to GitHub with comprehensive commit documenting all 10 code review fixes plus language cleanup. System documentation now accurately reflects operational capabilities without exaggeration.
- [4:55:20 AM] [Unknown User] File Update: Updated active-context.md
- [3:51:10 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Playwright MCP for UI testing
- [3:51:05 AM] [Unknown User] Decision Made: Business-focused tooltip design
- [3:50:59 AM] [Unknown User] Completed UI usability evaluation: Successfully completed comprehensive UI usability evaluation using Playwright MCP. Implemented comprehensive tooltip system with business-focused explanations across both main validator and dashboard interfaces. Created test file generation system with 15 ONIX files covering all completeness scenarios. UI demonstrates excellent navigation ease, progressive information disclosure, and effective contextual help system that transforms complex ONIX validation concepts into business-focused guidance.
